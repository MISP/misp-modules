    "features": "This module takes a domain, hostname or IP address MISP attribute as input to query the Farsight Passive DNS API.\n  The results of rdata and rrset lookups are then returned and parsed into passive-dns objects.\n\nAn API key is required to submit queries to the API.\n  It is also possible to define a custom server URL, and to set a limit of results to get.\n  This limit is set for each lookup, which means we can have an up to the limit number of passive-dns objects resulting from an rdata query about an IP address, but an up to the limit number of passive-dns objects for each lookup queries about a domain or a hostname (== twice the limit)."
