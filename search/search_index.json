Supported relation types for object references that are recommended for each object are the folowing: - transaction: - 'from', 'from_my_client': Origin of the transaction - at least one of them is required. - 'to', 'to_my_client': Target of the transaction - at least one of them is required. - 'address': Location of the transaction - optional. - bank-account: - 'signatory': Signatory of a bank-account - the reference from bank-account to a signatory is required, but the relation-type is optional at the moment since this reference will always describe a signatory. - 'entity': Entity owning the bank account - optional. - person: - 'address': Address of a person - optional. - input : MISP objects (transaction, bank-account, person, legal-entity, geolocation), with references, describing financial transactions and their origin and target. - output : GoAML format file, describing financial transactions, with their origin and target (bank accounts, persons or entities). - references : http://goaml.unodc.org/ - requirements : PyMISP, MISP objects liteexport \u00b6 Lite export of a MISP event. - features : This module is simply producing a json MISP event format file, but exporting only Attributes from the Event.
