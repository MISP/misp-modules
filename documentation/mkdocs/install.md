## Install from pip

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment 
(see here for instructions https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

Once the virtual environment is loaded just use the following command for a minimal installation that only 
allows MISP workflows (and a few other modules) to work:

~~~~bash
pip install misp-modules
~~~~

If you want to install *all* modules you might need a number of system packages installed. 
On Ubuntu these packages are `libpoppler-cpp-dev`, `libzbar0`, and `tesseract-ocr`. 

For an updated list, check the GitHub action used to test the build inside `.github/workflows`.
Once you installed those dependencies you can now install the optional `all` extra:

~~~~bash
pip install misp-modules[all]
~~~~

You can now run `misp-modules` by invoking it (you might need to reload the virtual environment to update the 
search path used for executables).

~~~~bash
misp-modules
~~~~

As a new feature, you can now run custom MISP modules installed on your system by using the `-c` option.

~~~~bash
misp-modules -c /path/to/your/module/root/
~~~~

Note that your module must be sited inside a directory identifying its type 
(e.g., `expansion`, `import_mod`, `export_mod`, `action_mod`).

For example your module is `custom_module.py` and its type is `expansion` the module's absolute path should be
`/path/to/your/module/root/expansion/custom_module.py` and the option to pass to `misp-modules` 
would be `-c /path/to/your/module/root/`.


## Install from cloned repository

In this case the only requirement is to install `poetry`.

Normally you just need to run `pip install poetry`, but see here for more alternatives 
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation.

Once `poetry` is installed, you can clone the repository and install `misp-modules` as follows:

~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules.git && cd misp-modules
poetry install
~~~~

If you want to install *all* modules, just run `poetry install -E all` instead.

Note that the dependencies will require a number of system packages installed.
On Ubuntu these packages are `libpoppler-cpp-dev`, `libzbar0`, and `tesseract-ocr`.

For an updated list, check the GitHub action used to test the build inside `.github/workflows`.

## Install the systemd unit

To run `misp-modules` as a service on a distribution based on systemd, you need to create the unit as follows 
and store it in a file `/etc/systemd/system/misp-modules.service`:

~~~~bash
[Unit]
Description=MISP modules

[Service]
Type=simple
User=apache
Group=apache
ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/misp-modules -l 127.0.0.1
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~~

Then, enable the `misp-modules` service and start it:
~~~~bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now misp-modules
~~~~


## Run the tests

To run tests you need to install `misp-modules` from the cloned repository, run the server, and then run the tests. 
You can do all these step with `poetry`.

~~~~bash
poetry install --with test -E all
poetry run misp-modules
~~~~

And in another terminal:

~~~~bash
poetry run pytest
~~~~

## Develop

If you plan to open a pull request you might want to make sure that `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` are not 
raising any errors. First of all, install the test dependencies as detailed in the previous section.

Once you have done that you can run each tool using poetry (`poetry run black` for example), 
but you can also install `pre-commit` to run those tools automatically before each commit just on the files you have 
edited.

~~~~bash
pre-commit install
~~~~

## Build the documentation

To build the documentation you can use the provided `Makefile`.
Inside you will find three targets:

- `generate_docs`: install the dependency and generate the documentation.

- `generate_docs`: build the documentation using `mkdocs`.

- `deploy`: deploy the documentation using `mkdocs gh-deploy`.

- `test-docs`: run a local server exposing the newly built documentation.

Note: you can either run the targets using `poetry` (default), or using the Docker image `squidfunk/mkdocs-material` 
by setting the environment variable `USE_DOCKER=true`.

## Run MISP modules

If you installed it using pip, you just need to execute the command `misp-modules` 
(source the virtual environment a second time to update the search paths).

If you installed it from the cloned repository, just use poetry, i.e., `poetry run misp-modules`.

## Run MISP modules in Docker

You can find an up-to-date container image and related documentation at the following repository: 
https://github.com/MISP/misp-docker .

## Install misp-module on an offline instance

### Using the PyPI index

Once `misp-modules` is available on PyPI, you can just download all the necessary packages:

~~~~bash
mkdir wheels
pip wheel misp-modules --no-cache-dir -w ./wheels
~~~~

Move the `wheels` directory to the target system, and install them there:

~~~~bash
pip install --no-cache-dir /wheels/*.whl
~~~~

Once again, using a virtual environment is recommended.

### Using a local copy

You have two choices, the first approach uses `poetry bundle` to export the entire virtual environment so you can copy 
and run it on the target system; the second one uses `poetry export` to export a `requirements.txt` file.

#### Using `poetry bundle`

This is quite straightforward, but it assumes your target system is relatively similar 
(same distribution, architecture, libraries).

~~~~bash
poetry install
poetry self add poetry-plugin-bundle
poetry bundle venv /destination/path/
~~~~

Remember you can add the `-E all` switch to the `poetry install` command if you want to install all dependencies.

#### Using `poetry export`

This is a bit more convoluted, and it is similar to how you would install `misp-modules` on an online instance.

Run the following commands to generate your very own `requirements.txt`.

~~~~bash
poetry lock
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
~~~~

Remember you can add the `-E all` switch to the `poetry export` command if you want to install all dependencies.

Now create the wheels of all the dependencies:

~~~~bash
pip wheel -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir -w ./wheels
~~~~

Note that `misp-modules` will not be part of the `requirements.txt` file, and you will need to create the wheel yourself:

~~~~bash
poetry build --output ./wheels
~~~~

Now you can move the wheels to your offline instance, and install them using the following command:

~~~~bash
pip install --no-cache-dir ./wheels/*.whl
~~~~
