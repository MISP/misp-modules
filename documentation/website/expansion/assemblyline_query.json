Credentials include the used-ID and an API key or the password associated to the user-ID.\n\nThe submission ID extracted from the submission link is then used to query AssemblyLine and get the full submission report. This report is parsed to extract file objects and the associated IPs, domains or URLs the files are connecting to.\n\nSome more data may be parsed in the future."
